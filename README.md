# Antifragile Office

An AI-native operating system for family offices.

## The Problem

Most family office systems are fragile: they depend on specific advisors, break when context changes, and don't compound knowledge over time.

**Antifragile Office** is different. It's a system that gets stronger from stress—where every decision, every review, every question makes the whole system smarter.

## Philosophy

### Build for Yourself First

This isn't a product. It's a real system I use to run my own family office. Every prompt, framework, and principle here emerged from actual use—not theory.

I build for myself → extract principles → share publicly.

### AI-Native, Not AI-Assisted

Traditional family office work treats AI as a helper. This system treats AI as a thinking partner embedded in every workflow:
- Investment reviews with AI that knows your thesis
- Tax scenarios explored conversationally
- Governance decisions with full context preserved

### Antifragility by Design

Fragile systems hide complexity. Antifragile systems expose it.

Every decision gets documented. Every mistake becomes a lesson. Every question trains the next answer.

## What's Here

```
principles/     # Core beliefs that guide decisions
frameworks/     # Reusable structures for common problems
prompts/        # AI prompts for specific workflows
decisions/      # Decision journals and templates
```

## Who This Is For

Principals and operators of single-family offices who:
- Want to leverage AI beyond basic queries
- Value systematic thinking over ad-hoc decisions
- Are willing to build their own system, not buy one

This is **not** for:
- Multi-family offices serving clients
- Those seeking turnkey solutions
- Anyone uncomfortable with AI in financial contexts

## Principles

1. **Decisions over data** — The system optimizes for better decisions, not more information
2. **Context is everything** — AI without context is just autocomplete
3. **Compound knowledge** — Every interaction should make future interactions better
4. **Transparent reasoning** — Show your work; hidden logic is fragile logic
5. **Personal first** — Build what works for you; generalize later

## Current State

**Early development.** I'm actively building this system and sharing as I go.

Expect:
- Rough edges
- Frequent changes
- Real insights from real use

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal project shared publicly. If something here helps you, that's the goal.

Feedback welcome via Issues. PRs considered if they align with the philosophy.
